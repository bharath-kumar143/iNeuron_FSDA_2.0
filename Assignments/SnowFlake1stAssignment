-----1st Question is to Load table and create Primary Key
----- In these I Have Assigned Primary as a Order_date.

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE BHARAT_SALES_DATA
(order_id VARCHAR(20),
order_date string PRIMARY KEY,                  /In these I Have Assigned Primary as a Order_date.
ship_date string,
ship_mode CHAR(15),
customer_name VARCHAR(25),
segment CHAR(12),

sub_category CHAR(15),
product_name STRING,
sales number(6,0),
quantity INT,
discount float,
profit float,
shipping_cost float,
order_priority CHAR(8),
year CHAR(4)
);

DESCRIBE TABLE BHARAT_SALES_DATA;
SELECT*FROM KI_SALES_DATA;            

--------2 Question is to Change the Primary key to Order Id Column.

ALTER TABLE BHARAT_SALES_DATA
DROP PRIMARY KEY;

ALTER TABLE BHARAT_SALES_DATA
ADD PRIMARY KEY(ORDER_ID);    -----Here I have Changed the Primary Key of the Table to  ORDER_ID as it Was First Order_date

---3rd Question Extract The Last Number After the  - And Create Other Column and Update it
Update BHARAT_SALES_DATA
SET ORDER_DATE=CAST(ORDER_DATE AS DATE);

Update BHARAT_SALES_DATA
SET SHIP_DATE=TO_CHAR(DATE(SHIP_DATE,'DD-MM-YYYY'),'YYYY-MM-DD')


---------4. Create a new column called order_extract and extract the number after the last ‘–‘from Order ID column..

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE BHARAT_SALES_DATA AS
SELECT*, REGEXP_SUBSTR(ORDER_ID,'[[:digit:]]+',1,2) AS ORDER_EXTRACT
from BHARAT_SALES_DATA;

--------5.Create a new column called Discount Flag and categorize it based on discount. Use ‘Yes’ if the discount is greater than zero else ‘No’.
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE BHARAT_SALES_DATA AS
SELECT *,
CASE
WHEN DISCOUNT>0 THEN 'Yes'
ELSE 'NO'
END AS DISCOUNT_FLAG
FROM BHARAT_SALES_DATA;

---------6. Create a new column called process days and calculate how many days it takes for each order id to process from the order to its shipment.

	CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE BHARAT_SALES_DATA AS
	SELECT*,
	DATEDIFF('days',ORDER_DATE,SHIP_DATE) as PROCESS_DAYS
	FROM BHARAT_SALES_DATA;

-----		-------7. FLAG THE PROCESS DAY AS BY RATING IF IT TAKES LESS OR EQUAL 3 DAYS MAKE 5,LESS OR EQUAL THAN 6 DAYS BUT MORE THAN 3 MAKE 4,LESS THAN 10 BUT MORE THAN 6 MAKE 3,MORE THAN 10 MAKE IT 2 FOR EVERY ORDER ID
		
		CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE BHARAT_SALES_DATA AS
		SELECT*, 
		CASE
		WHEN PROCESS_DAYS <=3 THEN 5
		WHEN PROCESS_DAYS BETWEEN 4 AND 6 THEN 4
		WHEN PROCESS_DAYS BETWEEN 7 AND 10 THEN 3
		ELSE 2
		END AS RATING
		FROM BHARAT_SALES_DATA;
